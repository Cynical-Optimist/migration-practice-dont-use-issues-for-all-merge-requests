# Practice repo for GitLab to GitHub migrations

Since we're planning to migrate the BuildStream repositories from GitLab to
GitHub, we need to practice migrations and explore the various options.

This is a test repo, designed to investigate the different options we could use
during the migration.

It'll need to have:

* Multiple branches
* Deleted branches
* Open issues
* Closed issues
* Deleted issues
* Open merge requests
* Open merge requests with deleted branches
* Merged merge requests
* Merged merge requests with deleted branches
* Closed merge requests
* Closed merge requests with deleted branches
* Deleted merge requests
* Issues that link to Merge Requests
* Merge requests that link to Issues
* Comments but the person doing the migration
* Comments by other users, who have the same username in GitHub
* Comments by other users, who don't have the same username in GitHub
* Comments referring to specific diff lines (in MRs)
* Mentions of specific users, who have the same username in GitHub
* Mentions of specific users, who have a different username in GitHub
